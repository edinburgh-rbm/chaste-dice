Running Chaste on DICE
======================

Move this directory to

	/disk/data/chaste

and change into it

	cd /disk/data/chaste

Set up the environment:

	. ./chaste_env

Then start building stuff:

	make -f Chaste.mk

Wait a long time.

Eventually a screen will appear that asks questions. Press 'c' twice and
then 'g'.

Wait some more.
